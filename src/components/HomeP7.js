              that even if the process is different, it still gives full score
              for answers that are correct. The second is that it displays a
              histogram of the student's percentage scores and it is interesting
              to see what other students' average score are. Finally, I
              appreciate that each question has feedback that explains any
              errors in our answers and provides the right answer to helps us
              identify our mistakes."

              "The past courses didn't allow us to see and go through past
              assessments or it took a very long time for them to be marked. So,
              in that aspect since SageGrader is presumably the reason for a
              quicker marking and feedback given it helps me as a student to
              look through and learn more through the feedback."

              grade assessments. I like how the feedback is fast and concise,
              also mentioning common mistakes the cohort has made, as well as
              the histogram illustrating the spread of the cohort's grades. So
              far, I have yet to come across an item that needs to be improved."

              out considerably faster. I would like to see Sage Grader
              implemented in similar courses. I think it allows for faster
              results for students and takes less manpower to manually grade all
              the quizzes. Furthermore, it removes any bias a teacher may have
              towards any student which is another bonus."
